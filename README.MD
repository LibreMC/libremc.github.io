## What is LibreMC?
The goal for LibreMC is to provide a suite of free, open source, and high-quality utilities for [Minecraft](https://minecraft./) by Mojang AB.

## Why "Libre"-MC?
- Libre, meaning *"free"* in Spanish, is also used in the software world to enhance the idea of *"freedom"* in FOSS. [https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html)
- MC = Minecraft, what LibreMC targets its projects to work for.
